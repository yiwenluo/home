This is the project for my personal profile page. 

For this very first version, it is just a minimalist page that displays my name and some links to my profiles on other sites. 

The social icon assets are from http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/

Future updates: 
- Run a formatter to format all the code. 
- A timeline section on the various products that I worked on.
